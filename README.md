# Tetris

This repository contains a simple Tetris game written in Javascript (ECMA Script 6).

I made this small Tetris project to learn the OOP components in Javascript 6.

The project is made available under the MIT license.

Feel free to use this project and the code as you please.

A demo of this application is accessible at:
